How do I add /usr/local/zend/bin to PATH, so www-data can execuate files in /usr/local/zend/bin ?

1. The first place where PATH is set is **/etc/login.defs**. 
There's a setting for root and a setting for everyone else.
2. Another place where you can define environment variables is **/etc/environment**. 
These settings will apply to everyone (you can't write arbitrary shell code there).
3. A third place where you can define environment variables is **/etc/profile**. 
There you can write arbitrary shell code. If you want a user-specific setting, 
there is the corresponding per-user file ~www-data/.profile. 
But this will only apply to console interactive logins; 
in particular it won't apply to cron jobs unless they explicitly source /etc/profile.

If you only need that PATH setting in a user crontab, you can write it at the beginning of the crontab. Note that you need the full list (PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/zend/bin), you can't use a variable substitution (PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/zend/bin won't work there).
