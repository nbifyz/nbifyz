Step 1 – Download TigerVNC Server package

In this installation process, this is really the tricky part.  We need to install the tigervnc software solution but there is no Ubuntu packages available for Ubuntu 16.04.  If you look on the official TigerVNC repository, you will see that there is no deb packages for Ubuntu 16.04.

You will need to either compile Tigervnc package on your own or find an existing debian package that can be used with Ubuntu 16.04.
Our Tigervnc deb package available for download 

For your convenience, we are providing you a Tigervnc debian package that we have been using for our test.  You can try to use this package but we cannot guarantee that this package would work for you. We will also not provide any support if the package is not working for you.  You can give it a try and see if it works….(use it at you own risk !)

    sudo dpkg -i tigervncserver_1.6.80-4_amd64.deb

You might see some warning and errors messages. Ignore these messages for the moment…

uXrdp_Install_4 

sudo apt-get install -f

sudo apt-get install xrdp -y

Step 5 – Configure the xrdp settings 

You need to specify which desktop to start while connected through xRDP session.  To perform this action, you would need to create and populate either the .xsession file (per user) or the /etc/startwm.sh (all users) with the proper configuration information (as described below)

1 –  Open a Terminal console and issue the following command (if you have only one user on your system)

echo unity>~/.xsession

Installation Process – The Easy Way

In this section, we will describe the installation process that can be used to access the Gnome Desktop Interface through the XRDP solution.  The easy install method means for us that we will use the standard xrdp package and install it. We will not perform any custom installation or use the TigerVNC software package.
Step 1 – Install the XRDP Package

As a first step, we need to install the xrdp package from the Ubuntu repository. To perform the installation, we simply issue the following command in a Terminal Console

    sudo apt-get install xrdp -y 

You might be prompted for a password. Provide it and wait for the process to complete
Step 2 – Install Gnome Classic Desktop

To install the Gnome Classic Desktop, you will issue the following command in a terminal console.

    sudo apt-get install gnome-session-flashback -y 
Step 3 – Configure your xrdp settings 

You need to specify which desktop to start while connected through xRDP session.  To perform this action, you would need to create and populate either the .xsession file (per user) or the /etc/startwm.sh (all users) with the proper configuration information (as described below)

1 –  Open a Terminal console and issue the following command (if you have only one user on your system)

    echo "gnome-session --session=gnome-flashback-metacity --disable-acceleration-check & gnome-panel"  >~/.xsession
